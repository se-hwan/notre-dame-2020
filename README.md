# Description
A random collection of projects and work done until my graduation from the University of Notre Dame in 2020. 
Completely unorganized, more of an archive than any kind of project.
# Content
- ```Arduino```: Collection of small Arduino projects I worked on in undergrad. Motion sensing, music player, etc.
- ```Python/2018```: Brief research project I did to try and predict the value of dominant eigenvalues of arbitrarily sized matrices. Currently, model can predict the next value of sine and Bessel functions, but never reached the stage to work on matrices. 
- ```angleSensor```: Senior design component. Given that COVID began in the middle of my semester for senior design, our team members had to remotely design and build individual components of our project (essentially an inverted pendulum). Code can read detected rotary encoder data and plot it real time. Was meant to be fed in to main controller as state information. 
- ```art```: Random collection of 3D/2D things I've built/drawn for art courses. 
- ```cavity_solver```: Computational fluid dynamics project. MATLAB code that solves for pressure and velocities of 2D flow in a square cavity. 
- ```go_research```: Short summary of plasma research done for Dr. David B. Go at Notre Dame. 
- ```kohm_projects```: Projects for Kinematics of Human Motion course at Notre Dame. Analyzed reaching, walking, running gaits in MATLAB. 
- ```robotics Projects:``` Projects for Introduction to Robotics course at Notre Dame. Implemented simple forward and reverse kinematics, PD torque control.
- ```Biomechanics_Final_Report.pdf```: Review of soft robotics field done for Biomechanics course.
- ```PIZZA_PROJECT.pdf```: Design of "pizza oven" project for Heat Transfer course.
- ```Reactor_Design_Project.pdf```: Design of nuclear reactor to isolate specific element for Nuclear Science course.
